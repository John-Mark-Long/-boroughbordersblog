Islington proved to be an excellent start to my adventure of running around the borders of each of the London boroughs. At just over a half marathon distance I was able to settle into a comfortable pace quite quickly. Living in London, I've really gotten into running through the city. There's something about the busy streets that keeps my mind off the actual running, which is a nice distraction. 

<br/>

Halfway through, it started to rain a bit, but it was really the wind that made things interesting and I was ocassionaly caught off guard by a strong gust as I turned a corner or left the shelter of some of the larger buildings. 

<br/>

About 17km in I had an intersting experience of being called over by a couple who had found themselves locked into waterlow park after closing. As it was now getting very dark and cold it turns out they had called the fire brigade to let them out but the firebrigade had missed this gate entrance and continued onto to the next further up the hill. This understandly quite worried couple asked if I could alert the firebrigade to their location. I of course agreed and as a bonus didn't have to deviate from my route to do so.

<br/>

My planned route was almost entirely navigable with only 1 deviation at just past the 19km mark due to a locked gate, which I considered climbing over for an embarrassing amount of time before deciding to run around to avoid any risk of injury so close to the finish. 

<br/>

This run in Islington was not just a physical journey but an adventure punctuated with unexpected encounters and the joy of lending a helping hand. It epitomizes the unique experiences urban running in London offers, beyond just the exercise and scenery. I eagerly anticipate the rest of my running adventures around London's boroughs.

The above map shows, in my opinion, that I was able to quite closley follow the border (shown red) with my run (shown blue) the gpx route can be found by navigating to the gpx tab at the top of this page. All the analytics of my run can be found on my garmin connect or strava profile linked in the contacts tab.
